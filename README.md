# MindMap Minimal

This project is a minimal single-page mind map editor implemented from scratch
and styled with Bootstrap. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to run it.
Click nodes to select them. Press **Tab** to add a child or **Enter** to add a
sibling. Double-click or hit **F2** to edit the selected node, or simply start
typing when a node is selected. Use the **Image** button to attach a picture to
the selected node. Clicking an image opens it almost fullscreen so details are
easier to see.
Click **Save JSON** to download the map with images embedded and
**Load JSON** to restore a saved file. Drag the background to pan and use the
mouse wheel to zoom. Branches from the root are automatically colored and
children are laid out above and below their parent for readability.
