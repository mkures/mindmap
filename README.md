# MindMap Minimal

This project is a minimal single-page mind map editor implemented from scratch.
Open `index.html` in a modern browser to run it. Click nodes to select them.
Press **Tab** to add a child or **Enter** to add a sibling. Double-click or hit
**F2** to edit the selected node, or simply start typing when a node is
selected. Drag the background to pan and use the mouse wheel to zoom. Branches
from the root are automatically colored.
